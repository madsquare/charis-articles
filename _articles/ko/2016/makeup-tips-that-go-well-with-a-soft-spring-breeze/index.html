    <h3><label>01.</label> Emphasize clear and flawless skin</h3>
    <p class="para">Spring 2016 will be the season for natural and clear skin rather than point makeup. If barely-there matted makeup was the trend last season, this Spring will be all about dewy, clear skin that looks like you’ve just washed your face.
However, it won’t be the overly dewy look that celebrities went for in 2015, but a natural shine that fits in everyday life. Skin should look deeply moisturized, as if dewdrops will roll down your forehead and nose at any moment. This dewy base makeup look is loved by all women, regardless of season. For dewy and clear skin, it’s important to take good care of your skin and only use a thin layer of moisture-intensive foundation.
Be careful not to go too far with the dewy look. It’s important to find a balance that makes your skin look glossy, but not too glossy. In order to do this, it’s pivotal to focus on ‘moisture’. Try using a product with great coverage and additional skincare functions, and a face oil serum to create a naturally glossy look. Once the oils absorb into your skin, they will make your skin look more dewy.</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> One-point makeup</h3>
    <p class="para">One-point makeup is taking the aforementioned clear and dewy look and creating a statement by utilizing a single color makeup product. What’s usually used is a lip product or eyeliner.
The point of ‘lip and eye one-point makeup’ is to make your eyes and lips stand out. The skill with which the point makeup is used draws a fine line between sophistication and gaudiness.
In order to achieve a sophisticated and stylish look, it’s important to choose a lip color that goes well with your skin tone. Don’t forget that you’re trying to draw attention to a single point! Emphasizing both the eyes and lips can lead to disastrous consequences.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Bright and glossy lip color</h3>
    <p class="para">‘Lips’ are great for pulling off a successful point makeup look. It’s possible to create a bright and glossy look that doesn’t make your lips look dry by applying a clear lipgloss over your color lipstick. Pop colors are set to continue to be a trend this season. Colors like wine, acid orange, hot pink and peach will continue to be hot colors. When choosing a lip color, keep in mind the color of your lips and your skin tone. These can change how a lipstick color looks on your lips, as well as outside influences such as temperature and humidity. </p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> Contouring makeup for a clean-cut look</h3>
    <p class="para">A much-loved trend of 2015 was contouring makeup. And it looks like that love will continue on in 2016. The key to contouring makeup is emphasizing volume and depth. The technique utilizes shadow and light to create depth perception by shading in areas like the hairline, jawline and under the cheekbones, while highlighting areas like the forehead, cheekbones and cheeks. It’s important to get the balance of depth just right to create a natural look. Use shadows for a calmer and softer look, and use highlights for a bright and lively look. A correct use of colors to suit one’s needs can make any makeup newbie succeed in contouring makeup.</p>
