    <p class="para">It’s the perfect weather for a day out, with warm sunlight streaming down and a cool spring breeze blowing. With people spending more time outside, the one thing that we must think about to protect our skin is fine dust. If we don’t diligently take precautions against fine dust, it can lead to a surge in acne breakouts.
The heavy metals inside fine dust enter the skin through the pores and break down the natural barriers of our skin, which not only causes acne breakouts, but also induces skin aging. This is why you should pay close attention if you are someone who wants clear and taut skin.</p>

    <p class="para">What can we do to protect our precious skin from fine dust? First, the easiest way to minimize skin exposure to fine dust is by wearing a mask. However, regular masks are not able to block fine dust from passing through, so it’s important to wear masks that have been recognized for their ability to block fine dust and yellow dust, and have been classified as sanitary aids by the Korea Food & Drug Administration.
Another tip is to use less oily makeup products as oil makes it easier for fine dust to cling to your skin. However, the most important tip is to be diligent about washing your face and keeping your skin hydrated. But don’t scrub too hard at your face to wash away the fine dust! That will only dry out your skin and make it more sensitive. Popular cosmetic brands have discovered this niche market and have begun releasing products that vow to protect skin from fine dust, so make sure you take a look to find a product for your skin type. It will help you keep your skin looking dewy and block fine dust from clogging your skin.</p>
