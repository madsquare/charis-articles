    <p class="para">Just like how a soldier needs his gun, a girl’s makeup isn’t complete without a lip product. Everyone has at least one lip product, whether they’re a teen just entering the world of makeup or a grandma over seventy living in the countryside.
With trend leaning towards clear and natural-looking skin, lip colors are becoming more detailed and varied.
The highlights of the recent ’2016 Hera Seoul Fashion Week’ were the various lip colors of celebrities, ranging from cherry to red, pink and coral. As the weather gets warmer, lip products get brighter and deeper, calling for our wallets.</p>

    <p class="para">MAC’s resident artist Romero Jennings announced that 2016’s makeup trend is ‘All or Nothing’. It reflects his vision of utilizing makeup in various ways to show off your unique color without going too far in one particular direction. But just like how there is no official makeup trend, products that break the status quo have flooded the market.</p>
    <p class="para">Tints, which last long but are usually dry, have been upgraded with an oily addition to create a glossy look , clear lip gloss have gotten an injection of color, and matte lipsticks now come with a layer of moisture. A variety of colors from cherry to coral, red and orange delight our eyes, making the phrase ‘Spring means pink’ an outdated one. </p>
    <p class="para">For people with warm-toned skin, which is the majority of Easterners, toned down reds, bright corals and oranges are the way to go while cool-toned skin goes well with bright cherries and pinks. When going for a lip-centric look, it’s best to make your skin look as natural as possible to make your lips pop. It’s okay to forgo any eyeshadow or blush products. However, using makeup to create lush eyebrows is a sure way to make your features more pronounced.</p>

    <p class="para">If you want to apply a lip product with a strong color but are afraid that it might be too much, we recommend using a gradation effect by only applying the product to the center of your lips and using your fingers to spread it out. Using ‘Laneige’s Two-tone lip bar’, which <Descendants of the Sun>’s Kang Moyeon made popular, makes creating a gradation look that much easier. If you want to make your lip color last longer, use a tint or lip pencil on the inside of your lips before applying a glossy lip product on top.
If you want a chic and intense look, apply a matte lipstick to your lips and use a cotton swab or concealer to smooth out the lines of your lips. If you prefer a natural look, use a light pink or coral beige tone to create a bright daily look.</p>

    <p class="para">This Spring/Summer’s lip trends are centered around creating a glossy and moisturized look, so don’t forget this when looking for a new lip product. Popular new products include ‘Chanel’s Rouge Coco Stylo’, ‘Tom Ford’s Patent Finish Lip Color’, and ‘Lancôme’s Juicy Shaker’, and you can’t forget MAC’s signature ‘MAC Flamingo Park Collection Lipstick’. They are perfect to create a sparkly, glossy look so they’ll be perfect for this season. Be smart about picking the lip color that goes perfectly with you every day.</p>
