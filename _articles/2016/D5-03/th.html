    <p class="para">Eyebrows can make or break a look. What happens when your makeup is on point but your eyebrows are faint or oddly-shaped? On the other hand, if a person’s eyebrows are well-shaped and groomed, they could still leave a better impression with a bare face than a person with full makeup on. Here are the basic rules to drawing eyebrows that maximize your beauty!!</p>

    <h3>Rules to drawing eyebrows that will change your life</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <h3><label>Rule 01.</label> Color of the eyebrows</h3>
    <p class="para">If you choose a color that is slightly lighter than your hair color, it will have the effect of brightening your entire face. If your eyebrows are naturally thick and dark, you can control the color by using eyebrow mascara. Getting your eyebrows dyed to match the color of your hair is also a way to reduce the time it takes to do your makeup. However, remember that if your eyebrows are too light, it can make you look dull. Eyebrows need to be dark enough to make your features pop.</p>

    <h3><label>Rule 02.</label> Where eyebrows begin and end</h3>
    <p class="para">If you have a lot of hair growing between your brows, it’s best to pluck and trim that area. But you should leave the tip of the brows if you want them to look natural. Trim the ends of your brows so they aren’t too thick. No matter which shape you choose for your eyebrows, they should look like they naturally thin out and taper off. </p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
    <h3><label>Rule 03.</label> The length and thickness of your eyebrows</h3>
    <p class="para">Think about what eyebrow shape best fits your face, and figure out where the arches will be. Draw a line from the arch to the end of your brow, and then lightly touch up the front of your arches. If your eyebrows are already quite full, there is no need to color in the front half of your brows. Imagine you divided your eyebrows into three sections; your arches should be the highest point of your eyebrows and two sections away from the front tip of your brows. If your arches are too low, you run the risk of ruining your eyebrows so be careful!!!</p>

    <h3><label>Solution 01.</label> Angular eyebrows for a round face</h3>
    <p class="para">If you choose a color that is slightly lighter than your hair color, it will have the effect of brightening your entire face. If your eyebrows are naturally thick and dark, you can control the color by using eyebrow mascara. Getting your eyebrows dyed to match the color of your hair is also a way to reduce the time it takes to do your makeup. However, remember that if your eyebrows are too light, it can make you look dull. Eyebrows need to be dark enough to make your features pop.</p>

    <h3><label>Solution 02.</label> Arched brows for an angular face</h3>
    <p class="para">If you have high cheekbones, or your jawline is strong and pronounced, you’ll be able to disperse people’s attention away from these areas with arched brows. The arches should be soft and round, not angular, to create a softer impression. Make sure that the end of the brows aren’t too thick. Arched brows should be thinner than straight brows.</p>

    <h3><label>Solution 03.</label> Straight brows for a long and narrow face</h3>
    <p class="para">If you have a long and narrow face, you should go for straight brows with very minimal arches. The brows will have the effect of making your face look shorter by drawing people’s gazes horizontally rather than vertically. The top part of your brows should be as straight as possible with no arches. If you naturally have arches, you can fill in the areas slightly above your brow line to create a straighter look. However, make sure you don’t draw your brows too thick or too thin; they should be just right.</p>

    <h3>* You’ll be in big trouble if you do this!</h3>
    <p class="para">If you try and replicate the eyebrows that foreign YouTube beauty gurus draw, you may come off looking too intense. Never fill in your brows too dark and thick from tip to end!! Also, whether you decide to draw arched or angular eyebrows, make sure you don’t go overboard with the angle as such brows don’t go well with a Korean facial structures.</p>
