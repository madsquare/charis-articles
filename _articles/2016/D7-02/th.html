    <h3><label>01.</label> Simple striped t-shirt!</h3>
    <p class="para">Striped t-shirts are basic items that go well with any clothes. This versatility, however, can make it seem too plain. Match a vivid-colored skirt with a striped t-shirt to create a vibrant and comfortable look. In contrast, going with achromatic color schemes for both top and bottom can differentiate your look. Also, when matching denim pants, you can add variation to the look by choosing long high-waisted designs.</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> Stylish 1 Stripes with Skirts!</h3>
    <p class="para">This summer’s trend features skirts of wide variety in length. Adding striped skirts can freshen up any look, so you can choose them freely without restrictions. Just make sure to match a tight top when wearing a full skirt.
    Doing so can boost your body proportion and add chicness. Push yourself to try unique colors, such as the vivid stripe-look by Dolce & Gabbana.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Stylish 2 Stripes with Pants!</h3>
    <p class="para">Striped pants are great statement pieces. To avoid overloading the look, choose a simple white color for the top. Also, keep in mind that matching top-and-bottom striped suits are not in vogue this year! Dresses or skirts can go well with horizontal stripes, but at least for pants, choose vertical stripes.They can make your legs look longer and more slender.</p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> Stylish 3 Matching Vertical and Horizontal Stripes!</h3>
    <p class="para">Matching stripes with dots is also a hot fashion trend this year. However, when you are matching different prints together, you have to check the scale of each. If both are too large, they might make you look like a clown. You can avoid mismatching by mixing small dots with big stripes, and thin stripes with big dots.</p>
