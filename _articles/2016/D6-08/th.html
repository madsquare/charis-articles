    <p class="para">The summer heat does not only wear you off physically. Your skin is also affected. Thoroughly applying sunblock is not enough. Sunblocks literally protect your skin from ‘ultraviolet ray’ to a certain degree, but they cannot prevent your skin’s temperature from increasing. The skin easily becomes red under the sunlight and this is a signal that its temperature is increasing. When the temperature of your skin goes up, excessive sebum will be excreted, resulting in wider pores and less elastic skin. In other words, high skin temperature means your aging speed is accelerated. If you want a younger-looking skin and want to keep your skin elastic for a long time, always remember that roaming under the sunlight with a blind faith in sunblocks will only advance your skin’s aging process.</p>
    <p class="para">The surest way to lower your skin temperature is to stay away from the sunlight as much as possible! But it is impossible not to go out in order to keep a cool skin temperature. Hence, we highly recommended that you grab a parasol when going out. Also, spray mists from time to time, which will help lower your skin temperature. Still, mists with alcohol ingredients included will make your skin dry so check the ingredients first when choosing what mist to buy. If you are worried about what product to buy among the many mists, pay close attention. Here are some of the best moisturizing mists that will brush away your skin’s thirst and heat without any irritation.</p>
