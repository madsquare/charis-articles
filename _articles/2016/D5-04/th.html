    <h3><label>01.</label> Treatment, it’s important how you apply it</h3>
    <ul class="step">
      <li><label>-</label> No matter how good a treatment product or hair pack is, it won’t be very effective if you just apply it all over your hair and wash it off right after you use shampoo. As long as you have a great treatment care routine, your hair will look great even with a cheaper product.</li>
      <li><label>-</label> After washing all the shampoo out of your hair, wring out all of the water. Then, divide your hair into around 10 sections and apply small amounts of treatment to each section. Be thorough with the application, combing your hair from top to bottom. You can maximize nutrient absorption if you massage the treatment product into your hair enough that your fingers don’t get tangled in your hair when you comb it. </li>
      <li><label>-</label> If your hair is severely damaged, leave the treatment product in your hair for 10~15 minutes.You can maximize the effects of your hair pack if you wear a vinyl hair cap and wrap a towel around your head. You can save time by showering and washing your face while you wait. </li>
      <li><label>-</label> When washing the treatment product off, use cold water. Using cold water instead of hot water helps hair become fuller and glossier.</li>
      <li><label>-</label> Small portions of the treatment product may fall on your back or neck while you apply it. Make sure you wash it all off as it may become the cause of back acne.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><label>02.</label> Change the way you dry your hair</h3>
    <ul class="step">
      <li><label>-</label> Never leave your house before drying your hair after a shower. Various dust molecules floating in the air will stick to your wet hair, making it dirty and easily tangled. You should dry at least 80% of your hair before you leave the house.</li>
      <li><label>-</label> Should we not scrub our hair with a towel like old men do when they dry their hair? Hair follicles that are full of moisture easily absorb nutrients, but are very weak as well. If you roughly scrub your hair with a towel, you’ll create cuticles on the outer layer of your hair. You should remove the moisture by pressing down on your hair with a towel.</li>
      <li><label>-</label> Use warm air to first dry your scalp. Drying your scalp becomes easier if you lift your hair up from the roots. Don’t dry the lower end of your hair when using warm air.</li>
      <li><label>-</label> Change to cold air and dry the lower end of your hair. This will prevent the evaporation of moisture from your hair, keeping it glossy and undamaged. You can use a fan instead of a hair dryer in this last step.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Be thorough with special products</h3>
    <ul class="step">
      <li><label>-</label> When using hair essence products and ampoules, use a towel to remove excess moisture from your hair, and apply the product to your damp hair before using a hair dryer.</li>
      <li><label>-</label> Most people just apply products to the entire area of their hair at once, but you should take small sections of your damp hair and lightly rub the product in. This will spread the nutrients evenly throughout your hair without missing a single section.</li>
      <li><label>-</label> If you’re using a curler or straightener when styling your hair, you won’t be able to avoid damaging your hair. Therefore, it is important to use hair essence products before styling your hair to prevent future damage.</li>
