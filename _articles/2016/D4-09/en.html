    <p class="para">The Face Shop has released a variety of products featuring the cute characters of Kakao Friends. The ‘it’ item from the line is the ‘Melting Color Creamer’, as it is both cute and functional. Not only does it boast a smooth and glossy application, it comes in five beautiful shades of red, orange and pink. The sunblock products that feature Muji on their packaging are also gaining popularity for being light, not washing out the color of your face, and even evening out your skin tone. The Face Shop’s concealers, which have been ranked very high for the past four years, have been re-released with new packaging that features the cute Kakao Friends characters, and it’s only a matter of time before fans open their hearts and wallets.</p>

    <p class="para">If The Face Shop has Kakao Friends, then Missha has Line Friends. Missha’s Line Friends edition line immediately puts a smile on your face with the cute characters of Brown, Sally and Cony. The ‘Matte Lip Rouge’ that features Brown on its packaging is especially gaining popularity amongst younger women for not only its longevity and color intensity, but also its light and soft texture, UV-ray blocking abilities and inclusion of oil nutrients. The brand’s ‘Tension Blusher’, which looks like a cushion compact product, is also a popular option as it has a mesh layer that helps apply an even layer, and boasts a smooth texture that looks like a mix between a liquid and creamy product.</p>
