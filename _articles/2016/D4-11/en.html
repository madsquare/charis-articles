    <p class="para">Does your face dry up no matter what you apply? Do you feel like even the best products simply wander on top of your skin without being absorbed? Then let’s start by changing the first stage of your skin care. Rather than applying extra layers of essence or cream products, simply add just one layer before applying skin care to boost your skin condition! Boosting serum is a Korean product gaining popularity abroad – we now introduce the most effective after wash product!</p>

    <p class="para">The first step in skin care is to apply boosting serums. As the name literally means “to boost up,” the most important function of boosting serums is to enhance the absorptivity of basic skin care products. In short, it prepares your skin so that it can well absorb the active ingredients within the cosmetic product.
Boosting serums are mostly not sticky but watery, so they don’t feel coated on your face and tend to fully absorb into your skin. Essence layering is also easier because application of additional serums (or essences) afterwards won’t get washed up.
Completely dried skins without any moisture won’t take in any product and the outer layer of your skin will especially continue to dry up. But entering the next step with a moisturized outer skin layer via applying some boosting essence will enable nutritious ingredients to soak into your skin quite well. Moreover, recently released products demonstrate excellent effects on removing dead skin cells. A separate physical peeling process is not necessary, since your boosting essence will lightly remove your dead skin cells every day.
Boosting serums are released in various product names for different brands, ranging from booster essence to first serum. But anything that you apply first at the basic care stage is a boosting serum. Make sure to check the product description, so you don't get it mixed up with general essences!</p>

    <h3><label>PLUS!</label> Adding BOOSTING SERUMs during Basic Skin Care</h3>
    <ul class="step">
      <li><label>-</label>If you’re using wipe toners (toners that are meant to wipe away residues), first use wipe toners and then apply boosting serums. On days with heavy make-ups, it’s better to wipe away your skin once more with a wipe toner and then use a boosting serum. On days with no or light make-up, forget the toner; it’s just fine to apply a boosting serum, a high-functioning essence and a cream, in the above order.</li>
      <li><label>-</label>To layer essences, apply products with oily ingredients after using boosting serums. Likewise, creams that form a coating layer on your skin shall be applied after boosting serums.</li>

    <h3><label>Ready Go !</label> Carefully Applying BOOSTING SERUMs</h3>
    <ul class="step">
      <li><label>-</label>After cleansing your face, don’t dry with a towel right away but apply your boosting serum while there is still moisture left on your face.</li>
      <li><label>-</label>You can use cotton balls if you have some, but if not, it’s okay to use your fingers instead to spread and apply the serum.</li>
      <li><label>-</label>Apply the serum softly, from the inside of your face in an outward motion. Don't forget to apply some around your nose, mouth and neck.</li>
      <li><label>-</label>Next, pat with your fingertips as if you’re playing the piano.</li>
      <li><label>-</label>Use your weakest ring finger to tap on areas with thin skin layers, such as around the eyes and mouth.</li>
      <li><label>-</label>Last but not least, slightly press with your palm to improve the absorption.</li>
