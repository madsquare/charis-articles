    <h3><label>01.</label> Protruding Tummy</h3>
    <p class="para">If you have a big stomach, dark yet colorful patterned one-piece swimsuits that are tight around the waist can counter your weakness. Sticking with achromatic colors all the time to counter your weakness can make you look like a student going to gym. Nowadays, two-piece swimsuits with tops that do not expose the stomach are easy to get as well. But if you still can’t forgo bikinis, the answer is high-waisted swimsuit. It’s an especially good option if your upper stomach does not protrude as much as your lower stomach. With their spanx-like design, they hold your lower stomach in and give the illusion of longer legs.</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> Small Chest</h3>
    <p class="para">If you don’t have enough fat, trying to create a cleavage by pulling your breasts together can look unnatural or flat on the side. Wear a halter-neck bikini that uses the cloth’s elasticity to push the breasts up. It’s even better if you choose a design that features elaborate embellishments on the chest such as ribbon, shirring, and fringes. Tightly woven, knitted swimsuits are also recommended.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Saggy or Wide-Set Chest</h3>
    <p class="para">Even with full breasts, your breasts may not look flattering if they are saggy or wide-set. For this body type, choose among bikinis with underwire that can firmly support the breasts. Choose bikinis as you would your bras, looking for enough support. Also, halter-neck designs that emphasize cleavage complement this body type.</p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> Plump Lower Body</h3>
    <p class="para">If you are worried more about the fat in your lower body than your upper body, the key is to guide the eye upwards. Reveal your shoulder and chest by wearing a one-piece swimsuit with low neckline. Counterintuitively, cut-out designs open at the waist give the illusion of slender waist as well. Bottom pieces with fringe or shirring also hide plump thighs.</p>
