    <p class="para">Feels like it was yesterday when we set losing weight as our new year’s resolution, but summer – the season of less clothes and more skin – is already around the corner. If everything went as planned, you would now be happily troubled over what bikini to wear on the beach this summer; but if you chose delicious foods (such as chicken and beer) over bikinis, you’re probably worrying about what clothes to wear to make you appear skinnier. Either way, exposure is inevitable in the summer heat. Thanks to the weather that makes you sweat just by breathing without the a/c on, it is simply natural to wear short sleeves often. But before you go out with your short shirts and shorts on, you have to double-check your elbows and knees. The keratin layers of your elbows and knees are fairly thick and if you haven’t regularly exfoliated, they can easily be stained in dark shades. During the winter, people do not exfoliate, because the stained spots are less visible as people wear longer sleeves, hiding most parts of the stained spots. Not taking care of the dead skin cells on your elbows and knees will only leave unsanitary impressions.
Therefore, body exfoliation is not an option but a must for confident summer exposure! But hard scrubbing to remove the dead skin cells is not good at all. Then, what are some of the most effective exfoliation methods?</p>

    <p class="para">After scrubbing your old dead skin cells for 3-4 times a week, you will clearly see a clean skin. To maintain those clean elbows and knees, exfoliate 1-2 times every week. But buying fruits or milk just in time for exfoliation is a bit troublesome than you might think. Take a look at this if you don’t want to bother yourself with buying fruits or milk.
