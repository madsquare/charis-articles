    <p class="para">I use Vodana Glamwave Curling Iron with a 40mm barrel, which is the biggest in the market. Bigger barrels create more natural curls so this is great for creating looser S curls and C curls. They available in 3 colors, black, blue and Pink

Hair Tutorial with Vodana Glamwave Curling Iron:
1. Heat up the curling iron. Most curling irons will need a little time to heat up before you can use them.

2. Split your hair into sections and Start curling.
Begin by taking a small section of hair and wrap it around the curling iron, beginning at the top or bottom

3. Play around to find a time that creates a perfect curl with your iron, but remember to start out with a lower time to prevent your hair from burning.

4. After 10 seconds, let go of your hair to release the curl. If your hair is still a little flat, try pinning it while it's still curled
