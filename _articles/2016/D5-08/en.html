    <p class="para">Memories of scent last longer than you think. That’s probably why we give perfumes as presents to celebrate becoming an adult and why we don’t forget to wear them before going out. But there’s one thing you should know before selecting perfumes. Perfumes are categorized into parfum, eau de parfum, eau de toilette and eau de cologne according to their degree of concentration, and are separated into top, middle and base notes in respect to the time the perfume was applied. Highly concentrated parfums last for 6-7 hours and exude rich fragrances. It is loved by perfume manias or those who enjoy intense scents. Eau de parfums last as long as parfums and their scents are deep yet not uncomfortable, making them the most popular kind along with eau de toilettes. Eau de colognes last for only 1-2 hours and come in fruity or fresh scents, suiting first-timers and/or for everyday usage. Now, test perfumes with a different degrees of concentration and select the one of your choice.
Top notes are sensed immediately upon application of a perfume and last for about 15 minutes. They are mostly appreciated by the possessor. On the other hand, middle notes are the main body of perfumes, sensed after 30 minutes to an hour upon application. Also known as the lasting scent, base notes are sensed 3 hours after spraying the perfume. The longer the base note lasts, the more likely the perfume is high quality. If you just check the top note when testing perfumes, you might regret your choice afterwards. Learn the top, middle and base notes first before choosing a perfume in order to avoid any mistakes.</p>

    <p class="para">Now that we have covered the basics for choosing perfumes, it is time to break away from stereotypes on perfumes. If you have considered perfumes simply to remove bad smells or have categorized them per gender, say goodbye to those old ideas. The hottest trend in perfume is ‘niche perfumes’ and ‘unisex’. The term ‘niche’ in niche perfumes literally refers to a small crack in the wall, meaning perfumes just for the few. As a lot of natural ingredients are included in niche perfumes to exhibit nature-like fragrances which accordingly change depending on your personal scent, people who look for unique perfumes that can embody their personalities love niche perfumes. Well-known brands for niche perfumes include Jo Malone, Dyptique, Annick Goutal and CREED. ‘BADAKHILI,’ recently launched in the contemporary multi-shop Beaker, is also a niche perfume brand. Furthermore, as unisex has become a trend, couples wear the same perfume and more women now prefer musky and woody fragrances. ‘Ferrari Light Essence,’ ‘Clean Warm Cotton’ and ‘John Varvatos Artisan’ are also popular among women, just to name a few. As perfumes now represent one’s identity, ‘roll-on perfumes’ that add on fragrances anytime and anywhere have become popular as well. ‘Tom Ford’ has released 3 of their bestsellers ‘Black Orchid,’ ‘Velvet Orchid’ and ‘Noir’ as roll-on perfumes. Furthermore, roll-ons from ‘Demeter’ are also selling well as daily fragrances.
Of course, even though niche perfumes and unisex is a trend, steady sellers that transcend time do exist. Like perfumes from Chanel, Lanvin, Bvlgari, CK and etc. The important thing is not what perfume brands I am wearing but whether I’m truly enjoying the fragrances.
With an open heart, choose a scent that matches your fashion or select a variety of scents depending on how you feel. It’s only a matter of time to meet your once-in-a-lifetime perfume when you decorate your space with fragrances. Oh, and don’t rub your wrists after spraying the perfume. Their unique scents might vanish.</p>
