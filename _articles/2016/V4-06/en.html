    note: "Apply a thin layer on your face and vigorously pat it down. (If you don’t do this, your foundation may clump)"

    title: Apply powder
    note: "Apply powder to the area around your eyes as a base for your eye makeup. If you don’t feel like it, you can skip this step."

    title: Draw in your eyebrows
    note: "Draw in your eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil, and then use your fingers to blend it in to create a gradation effect. You can also work on the contouring around your nose while blending your brows. You’ll be killing two birds with one stone."

    title: Apply eyeshadow
    note: Choose a color from your shadow palette and apply it on your eyes in a speedy manner. The key here is to not be ashamed. Color in the area below your eyes as well.

    title: Use eyeliner
    note: "If you want to make your eyes look longer, make the tail of your lines longer. Use the darkest brown color you’ve got to darken the lines you’ve drawn. Use a pearly color when underlining your eyes. Use your cushion foundation to touch up the areas you’ve pressed on with your hands while applying your makeup."
