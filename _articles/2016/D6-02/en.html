The treatment you thought would improve your skin might even bring about more damage. If you’re just back from the clinic, adequate post-treatment care can help rejuvenate your skin!</p>

    <p class="para">Clinical treatments work by letting new, improved skin cells form in place of the damaged skin. In particular, strong laser treatments like Fraxel or Thermage can damage parts of your skin layer and result in overall redness or tightness. It’s also quite common to experience redness, swelling, and temporary irritation! Fillers or Botox aren’t worry-free, either. Injectables also leave needle marks on the surface, as the needle penetrates the skin during the procedure. Added to this, the new skin layer may look bumpy due to uneven growth, or scars may form from the needle marks.</p>

    <h3><label>01.</label> Ultra-Strong Moisturizer</h3>
    <p class="para">Stripped of its protective barrier, post-treatment skin cannot lock in moisture and is prone to dryness and irritation. This applies to oily skin as well; choose a moisturizer that is more hydrating than the one you normally use. Some clinics try to sell their patients certain products under the name of ‘rejuvenating cream’. Clueless first-timers end up paying a lot for these products. There is no need to use expensive products as long as you use strong moisturizers that have rejuvenating properties. Products formulated for those with atopic dermatitis or severe dryness are even better!</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> Fragrance-Free, Alcohol-Free Products</h3>
    <p class="para">Skin becomes extremely sensitive after clinical treatments. That’s why you need low-irritation products. Choose products that are free of colorants, preservatives, alcohol, and fragrance, but the most important to avoid are alcohol and fragrance! Especially, products for acne-prone or oily skin types contain alcohol, and give a minty cool feeling when applied. These products further dry up the post-treatment skin, so they must be avoided. Put off using your favorite fragrance during the post-treatment period, as it may inflame your skin.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Sunscreen</h3>
    <p class="para">Lacking protective barrier, post-treatment skin is vulnerable to UV rays. If you are moisturized well after your skincare regimen, apply plenty of sunscreen when going outside and even when inside, if you are staying in a sun-lit place with many windows. Most crucial period is the month after treatment. On sunny days, it’s better not to plan for outdoor activities to begin with.  If you have scabs, you have to stay put until they fall off. Clinics these days emphasize in their ads that you can ‘put on makeup right after treatment’. Perhaps for that reason, many blindly trust the SPF (sun protection factor) of sunscreen contained in foundation or other makeup. But do not forget the fact that such products have limited effect in actuality since base makeup products can’t be applied thickly enough!</p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> Skin Soothing Masks</h3>
    <p class="para">If your skin is highly irritated and red, soothe your skin with some aloe gel or cooling pack. Rather than applying more products, choose a product with great moisturizing and soothing effects and apply plenty of it, and cut back on skincare products.


Stay away from products containing whitening or other special properties.
Such products may inflame the sensitive skin.</p>
