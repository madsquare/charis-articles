    <h3>Every Day Customized Cleansing STEP</h3>
    <p class="para">No-makeup yesterday and extra-heavy smoky eyes today! A girl’s makeup changes every day! Cleansing should vary depending on the heaviness of the makeup. If breakouts and bad skin texture are your concerns, cleansing may be the issue. So stop repeating the same cleansing routine! Here are some cleansing routines tailored to your needs. </p>
    <p class="para">Until several years ago, the concept of cleansing was restricted to ‘erasing makeup’, and it was not uncommon to see full makeup being cleansed with soap. However, all that has changed. Everyone has realized that the first step to skin care is proper cleansing, rather than putting more things on the face. The most important rule is to choose the cleansing steps that are proper to the day’s skin condition instead of cleansing with the same product every day. In particular, when you have full-makeup on from makeup base to eyes, lips, and cheeks, you have to put more effort into cleansing to prevent the makeup residue from discoloring the skin.</p>

    <h3><label>01.</label> No Makeup</h3>
    <p class="para"><strong>Step 1 Cleansing Foam:</strong> In whichever step, it is important to work up plenty of foam when using the cleansing foam. Since rubbing your hands can produce only a limited amount of foam, use a foam net sold in stores to get plenty of rich foam with little effort. Put this foam on your skin and gently rub as if rolling a ball. Do not irritate the skin by rubbing too hard. Wash your neck and ears, and remove the foam by washing more than ten times. Even if a product effectively removes sebum, waste product, and makeup residue, it is not a good product if it makes your skin feel tight right after washing. Choose a product that sustains a certain amount of moist feeling in your face after washing!</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> Makeup Base Only</h3>
    <p class="para"><strong>Step 1 Cleansing Water:</strong> Putting only base makeup on doesn’t make cleansing unimportant. Wouldn’t the absolute number-one product for light and gentle cleansing be cleansing water? Although it looks like transparent water, cleansing water has strong cleansing power and doesn’t require additional rinsing, and has thus been a go-to item for the lazy. Wet a cotton pad with plenty of cleansing water and wipe along the face for the base makeup to dissolve and come off on the pad. Rather than rubbing until the cotton pad is dry, pour more cleansing water and wet the cotton pad to avoid irritating the skin.</p>
    <p class="para"><strong>Step 2 Cleansing Foam:</strong> You can skip the cleansing foam if you have erased your makeup with cleansing water, but if you are feeling unsure, double-cleanse your face with a cleansing foam. The above steps are necessary even when you just applied sunscreen without putting any foundation or BB cream on. </p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Lip Makeup only</h3>
    <p class="para"><strong>Step 1 Lip and Eye Remover:</strong> If you leave lip tint or lipstick on your lips, your lips can become dry or peel off, so clean them off properly.</p>
    <p class="para"><strong>Step 2 Cleansing Milk or Cleansing Water:</strong> Before the foam cleansing step, soak two to three cotton pads with cleansing water and leave them on your face for a quick moisture-supplying cleansing mask. Cleansing milk is also another mild item with minimal skin irritation. Put it on and rub for one minute, and wipe it off with a cotton pad.</p>
    <p class="para"><strong>Step 3 Cleansing Foam:</strong> Cleansing milk allows milder cleansing than cleansing water, but it requires double-cleansing. Work up plenty of foam and rinse off after rubbing.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Smoky Eyes</h3>
    <p class="para"><strong>Step 1 Lip and Eye Remover</strong>: If the eyeliner and mascara are not properly erased, they may discolor the skin around your eyes and darken its tone. It is also likely to cause dark under-eye circles. Cut a cotton pad in half and soak it with a remover, and put it on your eyelid for around 20 seconds. You can then easily remove the makeup by wiping while gently pressing down. Some mascaras with strong curling or lash-extending formulae are not easily removed, and these require special removers.</p>
    <p class="para"><strong>Step 2 Cleansing Oil:</strong> Pump the oil twice on washed and dried hands. After rubbing it on your dry face as if massaging for two to three minutes, the makeup will dissolve. Then, putting some water on your face will make the oil turn white; rinse off after rubbing the nose, mouth, and eye areas with extra care. Some products with strong formulae can be used without separate lip and eye removers, but using the cleansing oil after cleaning the eyes and lips with a separate remover can help avoid discoloration.</p>
    <p class="para"><strong>Step 3 Cleansing Foam:</strong> After washing off the cleansing oil that has turned white, lather the cleansing foam and wash for the final time.
Rather than rubbing up and down or sideways, the key is to massage your face in a circular motion. </p>
