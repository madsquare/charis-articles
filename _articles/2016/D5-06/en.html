    <p class="para nomargin">On a clear day, the warm sunlight that brushes our cheeks is enough to lift our mood. However, there’s something that stops us from enjoying the sunlight fully, and that is UV rays, our skin’s mortal enemy.
When our skin is exposed directly to UV rays, it causes our skin’s aging process to speed up, and darkens our complexion by provoking pigmentations such as freckles and spots. If we want to protect our skin from UV rays, we must use sunscreen 365 days a year. But it isn’t easy trying to find a product that’s best for us when there are so many different products out there in the market. One wrong sunscreen purchase could even lead to more acne and other troubles.</p>

    <p class="para">Then, what should we check for if we want to succeed in finding the sunscreen product that is best for us? The answer is, looking at how a product blocks UV rays.
Sunscreen can be divided into two categories of <u>physical sunscreens</u> and <u>chemical sunscreens</u>, depending on how they block UV rays. The former creates a mineral protective layer that reflects UV rays, while the latter uses chemical components to convert UV rays that the skin has already absorbed into heat.Compare the pros and cons of the two methods and choose the one that is best for your skin.
The biggest merit of physical sunscreen is that it minimizes skin stimulation, but the biggest downfall is that it doesn’t last long and may cloud up your skin. The components in physical sunscreen may block pores and cause acne, so they require a thorough cleansing routine. We recommend this type of sunscreen of people with sensitive skin. On the other hand, chemical sunscreens do not have the cloudy effect that physical sunscreens have, but as they contain chemical components, they may make your eyes burn on contact and may cause dermatitis. Many cosmetic brands have recently released products that have maximized the merits and minimized the downfalls, and it will be worth your while to keep an eye on these products that have already been met with a positive response.</p>
