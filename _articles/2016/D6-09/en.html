    <p class="para">A slight change in the look of your sunglasses can make or break a look. Unique patterned frames and colorful lenses can look good on anyone. They’ll go well with anything, no matter what style you’re going for that day, so wear them with no worries. However, there’s no need to choose a frame that accentuates your facial flaws. Though you may be free with the pattern you choose, take care to pick out a frame that complements your face. Here’s how to be smart and pick sunglasses that cover your facial flaws!</p>

    <h3><label>01.</label> If you have protruding cheekbones / If you have an angular and square jaw</h3>
    <p class="para">If you have a face with protruding cheekbones and jaw, we would recommend round frames as they would soften your strong image. A variety of round-framed sunglasses have been released this year in conjuncture with the retro trend. However, if the lenses are too small, the sunglasses may make your face look bigger, so try out a few and pick a pair that adequately covers your cheekbones.</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> If you have a narrow face / If you have a bit of fat on your cheeks but a pointy chin</h3>
    <p class="para">People with narrow and triangular faces run the risk of having their face look too long, so a rectangular, square frame is most recommended. For those who have heart-shaped faces with a bit of fat on their cheeks, a square frame can cover your cheeks and make you look slimmer. Also, square frames look more sophisticated and luxurious than round frames. If you want to avoid looking too young, they may be a good choice for you.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> If you have a round face / If you have a small chin / If you have chubby cheeks</h3>
    <p class="para">Cat-eye sunglasses are perfect for people with round faces. The sharp design resembles the eyes of a cat and helps sharpen your round and plain image. A classic cat-eye design is one in which both the frame and lenses are pointy at the outer ends. There are also many products in the market this summer that have only altered the upper half of the frame to maintain the cat-eye look, so keep an eye out for those.</p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> If you have a long medial cleft and chin / If you have a long face / If you don’t have a lot of fat on your face </h3>
    <p class="para">Though Boeing sunglasses look good on everyone, they are an excellent match for those with faces that are much longer than they are wide. The moment a person with a long face puts on Boeing sunglasses, they look like they have an egg-shaped face.</p>

    <h3>+ Shopping Tip</h3>
    <p class="para">- Sunglasses with big lenses should have frames made of a light material. If they press down on your nose or feel heavy, then they’re the wrong sunglasses.
- Don’t buy your sunglasses online. Sunglasses that have similar shapes and sizes can look very different once worn. If you want to purchase them on online shops like online duty free or home-shopping stores, we recommend you visit a brand’s offline store and try the sunglasses on before making a purchase.
- Avoid buying sunglasses on your own. However, don’t listen to everything the store employee says. Employees will encourage you to make a purchase, even if the sunglasses don’t suit you. Listen to family or friends who will give you an honest opinion.</p>
