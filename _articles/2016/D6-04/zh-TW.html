    <p class="para">Long gone are the days when lotion was the one-for-all solution for men. Korea is number one in world consumption of men’s beauty products—meaning many men around you are actually paying careful attention to their skincare, though they may not be vocal about it. Many men are now able to tell the difference between toner and emulsion and distinguish waxing from shaving, while there are many ‘grooming groups’ who are more up-to-date about the latest beauty and fashion trends than most women. Ranging from sunscreen and BB creams to eyebrow pencil, brow mascaras, and primers, men’s beauty products in the Korean market are divided into so many sub-categories that their extensive range put women’s beauty products to shame. Even if makeup is too much for you, basic skincare is necessary to keep a tidy appearance and prevent skin from aging. We’ve compiled a list of men’s beauty keywords to protect your skin from summer’s glaring sun. </p>

    <h3><label>01.</label> Basic Care</h3>
    <p class="para">Strong summer sun and air-conditioning can easily dry out your skin. On top of this, since most men’s skin have bigger pores and more sebum than women’s, particular attention is needed to control the skin’s oil and moisture balance. After cleansing your face, prep your face by soaking a cotton pad with toner and applying while the skin is still wet. Finish with emulsion or serum and apply moisturizer on top for the perfect basic skin care.  However, this is undoubtedly too much to follow for most men who don’t want to bother with applying multiple products. Many all-in-one products that combine toner with essence are constantly being introduced for these men. If you are concerned with pores, wrinkles, or skin moisture, look for serum or moisturizers that address those needs. Biotherm Homme’s Aquapower line and Lab Series Pro LS All-in-One products are popular.</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> Sun Care</h3>
    <p class="para">You might skip BB cream, but sunscreen is a must in summer skincare routine. Keep in mind that sunscreen should be applied all throughout the year as basic skincare. Sunscreens preferred by men, of course, are non-sticky products that don’t turn white. Most of the newly launched products satisfy these requirements, so there’s no need to worry. One thing to watch out for is putting too much on for whitening or covering inflammation, since doing so may only lead to the embarrassment of a white, mask-like face. Avoid this by choosing the right product for your skin type. Choose a waterproof product if you sweat a lot. When staying outside for a long time, taking a sunstick along that is easy to reapply every 3-4 hours can be both effective and convenient. </p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Hair Removal</h3>
    <p class="para">As more companies are allowing summer shorts as work attire, more men are getting interested in leg hair removal. There are various removal methods such as shaving, waxing, taping, and using tweezers. Among these, shaving, taping, or using tweezers can easily hurt the skin, so removal cream or waxing is recommended for gentle and clean hair removal. These days, there are many at-home hair removal machines and natural waxing products with reduced skin irritation for men. One thing to keep in mind is that, whichever method you choose, you need to plan in advance for a week of aftercare to soothe the redness.</p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> Odor&Dead Skin Care</h3>
    <p class="para">Deodorant is a must-have summer item for men who sweat very easily. Deodorants are available in different varieties: spray, roll-on, and underarm sweat pads. While sprays leave your skin soft and dry immediately after application, they are difficult to carry and are thus better when used together with roll-ons. If it’s not convenient to apply deodorant outside, you might want to try underarm sweat pads. Also, don’t forget to remove dead skin on areas that are exposed when you wear sandals, short sleeves, or shorts, like your elbows, knees, and heels. Show off your good manners by using foot cream or scrub to keep your skin looking nice and neat.</p>
