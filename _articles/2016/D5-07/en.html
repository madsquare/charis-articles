summary: On a clear day, the warm sunlight that brushes our cheeks is enough to lift our mood. However, there’s something that stops us from enjoying the sunlight fully, and that is UV rays, our skin’s mortal enemy.

    <p class="para">Seasonal collections of famous fashion brands that summarize the fashion and makeup trends of the upcoming season at once are a must for trendy people. This season’s makeup trend, chosen by overseas fashion brands such as DAKS, Marc Jacobs, and M is ‘over lash makeup,’ highlighting the exaggerated eyelashes. The point is not curling one eyelash after another in a girly way. Rather, it’s in expressing big and thick eyelashes to define doll-like vivid eyes by lumping the lashes together or by extravagantly applying mascara on both upper and lower lashes as well as using fake eyelashes. This season’s trend is powerful and edgy lash makeup that makes runway models look like cartoon heroines or female warriors headed for war. Hence, during this scorching May, why don’t we focus our attention to eyelashes than to eye-lines. Over lash makeup is all about the exaggerated eyelashes, so the most important point is to know how to use mascaras and it’s even okay to skip eyeliners.  Slight touches of makeup base will also do for eye shadows. Perhaps, the easy-to-follow over lash makeup is good news for those who had difficulties drawing eyeliners. Mascaras are special weapons for women as volumized and lengthened lashes can make your eyes look bigger and highlight your nose bridge even when you don’t apply eyeliners. If you had been concerned about mascara lumps, you need to be chill about it, especially this season. Intentionally wearing mascaras to create lashes into lumps is the key to over lash makeup.</p>

    <p class="para">Exactly copying runway models just because it’s a trend can be a long shot – it is essential to reinterpret the trend so that it will suit you. Generally speaking, Asians have shorter and thicker eyelashes than Westerners, which means eyelash curlers and mascara fixers are essential for successful over lash makeups. Curlers are usually used in three steps to curl your lashes. Start from strongly curling the roots and moving outward to softly curl the lash tips.  Mascara fixers that prevent smudging are also effective in preventing your eyelashes from sagging. If you want more under lashes, applying some mascara fixer will help. After applying lengthening mascaras from the roots to the end in an overall zigzag, add another layer of volumizing mascara on the roots to complete a more affluent and powerful over lash makeup.  If you are afraid of any smudging underneath your eyes, tap some facial powder around the eyes before using the curler and wearing the mascara. If your skills are sophisticated enough, cut fake eyelashes into small pieces and attach them in between your lashes for a more perfect over lash makeup. Even if you’re not confident in using fake lashes, don’t worry because adding two or three additional layers of mascara with powerful curling and lengthening effects will also create similar effects.</p>

    <p class="para">Mascaras with great curling, lengthening and volumizing effects include ‘Lancome Grandiose Smudge Proof,’ ‘MAC False Lash Extreme Black,’ ‘Kiss Me Heroine Make Long and Curl Mascara’ and ‘Sisley So Curl Mascara.’ Lancome demonstrates excellent curls even without using curlers and is great for under lashes as well because it doesn’t smudge. Yet, they come off easily. MAC is wonderful in curling each and every eyelash and in filling up rather thin spots. Its most distinctive feature is that it’s a mousse type formula. Kiss Me is already famous for its powerful waterproof mascara with gorgeous curling and volumizing effects with no smudges. The fact that it is a bit difficult to cleanse off the product was a weakness but a new product to solve this problem will be launched in May. Sisley also demonstrates excellent curling and long-lasting effects, which is multiplied by the vitamin ingredient included in the product that makes eyelashes appear more abundant when constantly used. In addition, ‘Loreal Paris Miss Manga Waterproof Mascara’ that defines vivid eyes just like cartoon characters and ‘Maybelline New York Magnum Barbie Waterproof Mascara’ that creates exuberant eyelashes without empty spots, thanks to duo fibers covering the product, are the go-products for over lash makeup. Let’s boost our confidence and also show off hidden charming points with a much more powerful and fatal lash makeup! </p>
