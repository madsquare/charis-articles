    <p class="para">When summer comes, it isn’t only our skin that gets oily. Even when we wash our hair in the morning, sweat and sebum quickly turn our hair oily by the afternoon, and the scorching heat reddens our scalps. We have to take special care during the summer season as being off guard can quickly dry out and ruin our precious hair follicles. Just knowing how to take care of our scalps and shampoo correctly can help us easily protect our hair.</p>

    <h3><label>01.</label> Find out what type of scalp you have</h3>
    <p class="para">In order to maintain a clean and healthy scalp, it is important to first and foremost find out what kind of scalp you have. Just like how you select makeup products based on your skin type, you should also choose your shampoo based on your scalp type. If your hair doesn’t become oily and still looks like you just showered even when you wash your hair once every two days, then you have a dry scalp. Your scalp may be so sensitive that a change in weather could quickly make your skin feel taut and itchy, so you have to focus on maintaining a balanced amount of protein and moisture in your scalp. On the other hand, people with oily scalps who wash their hair in the morning will still end up with oily and sticky hair in the afternoon. If your scalp starts to smell or you start noticing dandruff, that means you are prone to early hair loss, so beware of these signs. It’s important to use a shampoo that’s made for oily scalps, and it’s best not to aggravate your scalp through excessive exfoliation. If you have an oily scalp but dry hair, then your scalp is of the combination variety. For such a scalp, you should use a shampoo that’s made for oily scalps and use a treatment product on your hair, making sure that you keep the treatment product away from your scalp. If you have a balanced amount of oil and moisture in your hair with milky-white and clear skin on your scalp, you have a normal and healthy scalp.</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> The right way to using shampoo</h3>
    <p class="para">Most people will take great care in applying their makeup, but will only spend three minutes washing their hair. Many wash their hair in record time and don’t apply any products that provide moisture or UV protection for the scalp. It’s only a matter of time before our scalp and hair succumb to the summer heat. Therefore, we need to first change how we wash our hair. When you wash your hair, use lukewarm water to wet your hair. Remember that even if you just use water, it removes some of the waste and dead skin cells from your head. In other words, there is no need to use too much shampoo. It’s best not to use products that have a surface active agent, so don’t forget to check the ingredients before using a shampoo. Most people apply shampoo directly on their hair and massage it in, but what you should be doing is using your hands to foam up your shampoo before applying it to your hair. If you are using a shampoo bar, use a pocket bubble product to easily create enough foam. If you have an oily scalp, you should consider shampooing your hair twice, using a shampoo with organic ingredients the second time around. For both oily and dry scalps, just using a good shampoo to remove all waste and dead skin cells from your hair can be enough, and you should do so by using your fingertips instead of roughly rubbing it in. When you use conditioner or a treatment product, make sure it doesn’t touch your scalp, and let it sit in your hair for about 3 minutes instead of immediately washing it off. If you have dry or damaged hair, use a hair pack or ampoule once or twice a week to inject more nutrients into your hair. When you wash your hair, be thorough and make sure that there isn’t any shampoo or treatment product remaining in your hair. Don’t forget that the more time you spend on washing your hair, the higher your chances of having a healthy scalp and a head of hair.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> How to get healthy hair</h3>
    <p class="para">Once you’ve washed your hair in the correct way, it’s now time to make your hair shine and look luscious. You first need to learn how to properly dry your hair. Instead of shaking the water out of your hair with a towel, firmly dab the towel on your hair to remove the excess water before using a hair dryer. When you use a hair dryer, you must first dry your scalp with cold air. If you don’t have a lot of hair, it’s best to bend over and dry your hair in that position. Going outside with wet hair increases the risk of damaging it, so you should never go outside with wet hair during the summer. It’s best to avoid going outside when the sun is at its strongest, but if you have to go out, then use a hat or parasol to protect your hair. What you eat doesn’t only affect your skin, but your scalp and hair as well, so make sure you’re drinking enough lukewarm water and getting all your vitamins. If your scalp is in a bad condition, consider changing your eating habits. If you simply dry your hair after a day out in the water, it can dry out your scalp and make it extra sensitive, so you should never forget to shampoo your hair in such situations. There are many SPF hair products in the market these days, so take advantage of hair essence products and oils that protect your hair from UV rays to maintain a healthy head of hair during the summer.</p>
