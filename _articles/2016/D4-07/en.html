    <p class="para">NEAT is an acronym for ‘Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis’. Our bodies burn calories through a variety of activities such as regulating body temperature, digesting and excreting, breathing, and keeping our brain functioning. NEAT encompasses the energy we spend on our ‘metabolism’. This includes the energy we use doing normal day-to-day activities such as putting on clothes, doing our makeup and eating.
Without changing your daily habits, you will 100% fail by only relying on exercise and going on a diet. Though it may seem like you’ve succeeded in the short run, your weight will end up yo-yoing because it will be difficult to maintain those dietary restrictions for a long period of time. Only celebrities have the time to exercise 3 or 4 hours a day. Not only this, but exercising actually doesn’t burn that many calories. Running on the treadmill for 20 minutes will only burn 200kcal, which is equivalent to a bowl of rice.
Because of this, the NEAT diet is a great way to maintain a great body for the busy and tired. This is because it is based on the theory that if you increase your NEAT calories, you can still lose weight without having to make time to exercise. If you incorporate small movements into your daily routine, you will increase your muscle mass and metabolism. In conclusion, it will stop your body from storing fat, or make it easier to remove the fat that’s already stored in your body. These new habits will ensure that you won’t have to worry about yo-yoing after your diet ends.
Of course, it isn’t easy to overhaul your day-to-day routine. However, it helps to make even small changes like standing up to do activities you’d normally do sitting down. Bit by bit, add more movement into your life.</p>
