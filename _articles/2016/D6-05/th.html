    <h3><label>01.</label> Eyebrow</h3>
    <p class="para">If you’re worried about your eyebrows washing off while you’re in the water, you need to make preparations for your eyebrows a day in advance. Take advantage of the many self-tattoo eyebrow products that are in the market right now. Right before you go to bed the day before, use a tattoo eyebrow product to thickly draw in your eyebrows. The longer you have them drawn on, the longer they’ll stay waterproof, so if you’re someone with light eyebrows, don’t forget this step.</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> Base</h3>
    <p class="para">The key point to waterproof base makeup is to make it look natural and have it last long. It’s better to use concealer to finish off your base makeup instead of using base makeup products or BB cream, which are both weak in water. First, use a primer to capture the sebum between your pores, and apply multiple thin layers of concealer to create a longer-lasting look. You should focus on covering your blemishes when you use a concealer for your base makeup. To finish off and add to your waterproof look, lightly pat down your skin with a sebum control powder instead of regular powder or a cushion compact. Spray your face with a makeup fixer and let it set and absorb to create an even stronger base makeup look. However, most waterproof products are quite matted, so don’t forget to inject your skin with enough moisture before you start with your base makeup.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Eye</h3>
    <p class="para">It’s better to use a pencil or stick-style eyeshadow over a powdered product as they last longer and create a cleaner finish. Use a peach or gold hue on your eyes as a base, and draw in your eyeliner with a strong, blue color to create this summer’s trendy blue eye makeup look. It’s best to use a liquid eyeliner for your waterproof makeup look. In order to minimize the risk of your eyeliner running, only draw in the tails of your eyes with the eyeliner. Before using mascara, use a mascara fixer to set your eyelashes and use a waterproof mascara to keep your eyelashes curled for a long time.</p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> Lip</h3>
    <p class="para">If you’re worried about your lips looking too pale, use a lip tattoo product in the first step to lock in the color of your lips. Even if you don’t use a lip tattoo product, a continuous stream of long-lasting lip products that don’t smudge are being released, so pick the one that’s best for you. You could create a long-lasting look by applying multiple layers of water tint. Lip products that also work as a blush or eyeshadow are great for a speedy look, and make it easier to carry your makeup products to your holiday destination. Bright, full lips are better suited for the water than gradation looks, so keep that in mind.</p>
