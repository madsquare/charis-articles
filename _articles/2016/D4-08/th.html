    <h3>How to maintain a fragrance that attracts attention</h3>
    <p class="para">Have you ever found yourself frowning because of someone’s body odor? The way one smells is an important factor in determining first impressions and your image. However, we often can’t smell ourselves, which can hinder our social activities. A single mistake can drive away someone you’re interested in. Here are some tips to control your body odor to preserve your social life.</p>

    <p class="para">When you meet a guy at a blind date and smell a strange odor coming from him, that smell will stay in your mind. So the next time you meet, you will think that the same smell is coming from him, even when it isn’t. It’s one way your brain distorts reality. Because of this, it is difficult to change your first impression of how someone smells. So it is a bigger issue than one’s external appearance, like outfits, hairstyles or makeup; because for those, you have a chance to fix them if your first impression wasn’t great.
Whether you’re meeting someone of the opposite sex or the same sex, or whether you’re meeting a coworker or client, people always smell whoever they are meeting in an offline setting. No one likes to smell another person’s sweat, bad breath or armpits. Whatever they thought of you before will be erased with a single wiff of bad body odor.
However, body odor doesn’t go away with a simple wash. How you smell will change based on your eating habits, your day-to-day activities and the condition of your body that day. It’s like taking your genetically formed body odor and adding more layers of odor with your day-to-day activities.</p>

    <ol class="step">
      <li><label>①</label>Your breath will smell bad when you haven’t eaten in awhile. Make sure you don’t skip any meals, at least for the sake of how your breath smells.</li>
      <li><label>②</label>Dental diseases like cavities, sinus infections and tonsillitis can also affect how your breath smells, so take care of those.</li>
      <li><label>③</label>Avoid eating food with garlic, scallions, onions and mustard for lunch.</li>
      <li><label>④</label>Avoid eating too much meat, eggs, butter, and dairy products like cheese and milk.</li>
      <li><label>⑤</label>Drink as much water as you can, but drink it in intervals.</li>
      <li><label>⑥</label>When brushing your teeth, always scrape your tongue as well. Bad breath doesn’t come from your teeth, but from any leftover coating on your tongue. Use your toothbrush or a tongue leaner.</li>
      <li><label>⑦</label>After eating at a restaurant, go for a walk or do similar activities to remove the smell from your clothes. Place a fabric deodorizer near your door.</li>
      <li><label>⑧</label>When showering, make sure you thoroughly soap up and wash your armpits, belly button, crotch and toes.</li>
      <li><label>⑨</label>After showering, put on your clothes only after you’ve completely dried off. Choose clothes that support air circulation.</li>
      <li><label>⑩</label>Get enough sleep. A lack of sleep can also attribute to bad body odor.</li>
