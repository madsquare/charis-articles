    <p class="para">As mask fanatics are increasing and ‘one-mask-a-day’ is trending, it seems certain that the reign of ‘sheet masks’ is still ongoing.
Of course, other masks such as wash-off masks or rubber masks are also popular, and many either love or hate sheet masks. Still, there is a reason why they are continuously sought after. They are undoubtedly convenient as you can simply put them on and off your face, and they are also portable and mostly affordable. That’s not all. They show immediate effect after fifteen to twenty minutes of use, and come with a variety of features like brightening, soothing, and moisturizing that you can choose according to your needs. In particular, Korean sheet masks have been crucial in spreading K-beauty around the world with high product quality and fast product launch.
Among them, Mediheal is so popular that it opened a flagship store in Myeongdong with just a line of masks. Lying down with a mask sheet on after cleansing at night refreshes not only your skin but also your mood, and putting one on before makeup helps the makeup to adhere well. As such, many more people are going beyond the one-mask-a-day routine to do two-masks-a-day. One thing to be aware of when doing one-mask-a-day is to choose masks that focus on moisturizing. Masks that focus on nourishing may cause your skin to breakout if they are used every day, so use them 1-2 times per week instead. The biggest advantage of sheet masks is their quick, in-depth moisturizing and nourishing of the skin. To achieve this, what you do before and after the pack is also important. Before you put the sheet on, exfoliate your skin and open up the pores with a hot towel. After the mask, close your pores with a cold towel and apply plenty of moisturizing cream to maximize the effect. Try not to keep the mask sheet on for over twenty minutes. The newly released sheet masks are armed with further upgraded features. The Oozoo emphasized freshness of their product by introducing syringe-style ampoule that can be mixed with the base solution, and Estee Lauder introduced PowerFoil Mask that contains half bottle of its Advanced Night Repair.</p>

    <p class="para">Sheet masks never stop evolving, from sheets that are hung on the ears for lifting and improved adherence to sheets for individual parts and plaster masks that are peeled off instead of washed. ‘Red Ginseng Hydrogel Goldmask Pack’ by Abelrouge Cosmetic—a brand known for specializing in clinics and television broadcasts—has been garnering attention with its water-soluble sheet mask. After putting the sheet on your face, you can dissolve it in warm water for a spa and double its use. Containing red ginseng extracts that have saponin—an anti-aging element—along with oriental ingredients and herbal extracts, the product also doesn’t scant on firming, moisturizing, nourishing, or soothing. Its 100% pure hydrogel mask closely adheres to the skin without causing irritation.</p>

    <p class="para">Hydrogel masks allow the essence to seep into your skin more slowly than regular sheet masks, so choose them for a better effect when you have the time. Also launched are sheet mask products that contain pearl elements for translucent skin. Klavuu’s ‘White Pearlsation Enriched Divine Pearl Serum Mask’ is one of such products. Its patented sheet fabric allows tight adherence to faces of all shapes, and it is soaked with one serum bottle-full of Korean pearl extracts and seaweed elements that brighten and tighten wrinkles. The mask feels as soft as cashmere to the touch, and those with allergic skin can use it without the worry of irritation.  Treat your face with a sheet mask today.</p>
