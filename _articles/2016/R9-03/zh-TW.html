    <p class="para">Hello loves! :)

Here's my very first review video about a Korean face mask, INSbyN vita brightening system mask which is my current obsession at the moment! More makeup videos are coming so please watch out for it.

Disclaimer though that this was my entry for a beauty event made by Charis but all the thoughts and opinions are my own. #CHARIS #CharisCeleb

By the way, Charis is the world's first influencer based commerce platform. You can purchase the face mask here in their official site.
