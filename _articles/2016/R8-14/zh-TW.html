    <p class="para">I was curious about the brand, Glamskin, as well as its products while browsing CHARIS, an onlineinfluencer store based in South Korea. (Read about CHARIS here). And while this Glamskin body lotion doesnâ€™t really stand out beside some promising skin care products at CHARIS, it is surprisingly a gem. The super cute printed artwork on the box is one thing (well, what can we expect? Koreans sure do have their way with packagings); the smell and the way it gives moisture to my skin? Superb! / continue to blog
