    <h3><label>01.</label> T-shirts & Shirts</h3>
    <p class="para">During the rainy season, it’s best to choose cool-toned hues. Though white clothes do look refreshing, those with thin material run the risk of becoming see-through when soaked by rain. When wearing light colors, pick a thicker material and make sure you wear the adequate undergarments. Though cotton is cool and dries well, it also runs the risk of being see-through, so be cautious when wearing cotton clothing. If you’re thinking of wearing denim, pick a washed denim material as it is thinner and dries much easier after being soaked in the rain.</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> Rain boots</h3>
    <p class="para">If you wear rain boots with nothing covering your calves, you may end up with the worst case scenario of collecting rainwater between your calves and the inside of your boots. In order to stop this from happening, consider matching your boots with tight skinny jeans rather than a skirt or shorts. When buying your boots, make sure you check how well they fit your calves as well as your feet. The looser they are, the more rainwater will collect inside them. Also, yellow or navy-colored boots may come off looking like the waterproof boots worn in construction sites, so these are colors to avoid.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Jelly shoes </h3>
    <p class="para">The trend of cheap jelly shoes came and went 10 years ago, but they’ve recently resurfaced as a must-have item for the rainy season. Because they are made with a material that doesn’t absorb water, jelly shoes dry quickly with a good shake after a day out. Other than the regular jelly shoes, a variety of slippers made with waterproof material that don’t get easily damaged by water have also been released, so keep an eye out for those. It’s important to check that the shoes aren’t slippery when you put them on.</p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> Waterproof watches</h3>
    <p class="para">Make sure you put away all your watches that aren’t waterproof during the rainy season! Though jelly watches are quite popular during the rainy season, the very cheap ones may not actually be waterproof. If you are planning on using a jelly watch as a fashion accessory, you could do so as long as you ignore the ‘watch’ function of it. We recommend choosing refreshing colors like blue, white, or neon colors for the perfect summer watch.</p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> Bags</h3>
    <p class="para">Using an eco-bag when it’s extremely humid and constantly raining is a recipe for disaster. You run the risk of not only getting your bag soaked, but the contents of your bag as well. However, you should also avoid leather during the rainy season as it is weak to humidity and may be prone to mold. Wicker bags, a staple summer item, should also be avoided during the rainy season. It’s best to use a bag made of materials that can withstand the rain such as synthetic leather or vinyl.</p>
