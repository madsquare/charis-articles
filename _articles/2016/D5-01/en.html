    <p class="para">Spring, the time of the year when people wear fancy blouses, and love pink-shaded makeup products that match their outfits. Rose quartz color products especially pop out this spring. It is a must item to create a lovely and fresh vibe. </p>

    <p class="para">But no matter how bubbly the color of the product is, one condition needs to be met first to really prove its potential—a neatly ready skin. Without it, the shadowed skin tone presents an overall weary look and the makeup itself would not adhere to the skin, easily coming loose. This is why before putting on make-up, you have to take care of moisture-sebum balance control and dead skin cells. Especially for dry skin types, a more elaborate care is a must, not an option during the spring season. Always remember the spring wind is as scary as winter heaters for dry skins. The following are personal recommendations by a dry skin type editor, who suffers from skin drought every spring.</p>
