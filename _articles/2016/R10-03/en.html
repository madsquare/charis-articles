      hey my internet peeps!

      This makeup tutorial is my go to fall makeup look or go to glam makeup. I have been loving dark lips and dramatic eyeshadows for the fall to be honest perhaps because I have seen tons of instagram baddie makeup tutorial and was so inspired by that look. I really hope you guys enjoy this fall makeup video and recreate the makeup look.

      Review for Klairs BB Cushion
      CHARIS was kind enough to send me a korean makeup product to try. So i picked out this Klairs BB Cushion and guess what? I am addicted to this product. the design, packaging, scents, and quality are all amazing. i dont ever want to run out of this product. it doesnt have a strong scents that would make you feel uncomfortable. the scent is very soft and addicting haha. it covers my little blemishes and redness, since i dont like wearing foundation everyday, this product is perfect for me because i want natural look for my everyday face.
