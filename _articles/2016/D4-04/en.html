    <p class="para">Using highlights to make a person’s nose and forehead more pronounced, and using shadows to shave down a person’s jawline and cheekbones to create a small and sharp-featured face! However, don’t dive blindly into the art of contour makeup. Here are some tips to avoid the outdated heavy makeup style look.</p>

    <h3><label>01.</label> Be wary of stick products</h3>
    <p class="para">- Affordable contour sticks have become all the rage in beauty stores and online brands. Like many famous YouTubers have demonstrated, you use the stick product to precisely draw contour lines on your face, and then blend out the lines.
- Stick products are usually dry and difficult to blend out. If you don’t properly blend it out, it will really look like you’ve drawn lines all over your face. You have to blend out the lines as naturally as possible if you don’t want to end up looking like a woman in a Picasso painting.
- People with dry or sensitive skin should use liquid-based products rather than stick products.</p>

    <h3><label>02.</label> If you aren’t careful, you’ll remove your makeup</h3>
    <p class="para">- Contouring takes place after applying a base product on your face. If you press down too hard with your brush or hands, you run the risk of accidentally removing the base product off your face. Everything needs to be in moderation!
- If you apply too dark of a shadow on the lines of your nose to make your nose look more sharp, your makeup will look awkward.
- Your blending brush should be quite soft. This applies especially to those with sensitive skin.
- If your contour makeup is too greasy, your makeup will quickly melt off. Or it will cause your hair to stick to your jaws or cheeks. It’s important that you use a powder-type product along the sides of your face.</p>

    <h3><label>03.</label> Never use products with big pearl particles</h3>
    <p class="para">- If your product has big pearl particles, they may clog your pores or make your makeup clump and look unnatural.
- Never use a pearly shading product when contouring your jawline or nose. A pearly product is sure to lead to failure if you’re going for a natural look!!
- It’s OK for highlight products to be slightly pearly. Apply a thin layer to your forehead, nose (T zone), and the side of your eyes (C zone).</p>

    <h3><label>04.</label> Avoid reddish hues</h3>
    <p class="para">- Avoid products that are brown with a reddish hue. It won’t go well with your base makeup and will look unnatural.
- It’s best to look for a soft brown color. You should always test out a shading product before making a purchase.
- For the most natural look, look for a product that isn’t too dark or too light compared to your natural skin tone; it should either be a half tone darker or lighter than your skin color.</p>
